Introduction
============

**Riscduino** is a Open source, 32 bit RISC V based SOC design targetted to pin compatible with arudino platform.
This project uses only open source tool set for RTL to GDS implementations. 
The SOC follows openroad/openlane flow and development environment is compatible with efabless/carvel MPW methodology.

The Github Repo could be found here:`Riscdino database <https://github.com/dineshannayya/riscduino/>`_
and database include all the RTL, Verification and Silicon implementation scripts. 

The documentation contains the following chapters:

* :doc:`description` contains the general information about the Riscduino SoC,
* :doc:`getting-started` contains the general information about how to use the Riscduino SoC,
* :doc:`tool-versioning` contains the tool versions prefered for usage with the current Riscduino SoC,
* :doc:`quick-start` contains a guide on how to get quickly started with using Riscduino SoC without many details,
* :doc:`riscduino-with-openlane` contains information on how to build your user project with OpenLANE inside the Riscduino SoC,
* :doc:`mpw-shuttle` contains information about riscduino project in different MPW shuttle
* :doc:`simulation` contains information on how to simulate,
* :doc:`pinout` describes the pinout of the SoC,
* :doc:`riscv` describes the RISCV configuration,
* :doc:`qspi` describes the SPI configuration,
* :doc:`uart` describes the UART interface,
* :doc:`usb1.1` describes the USB1.1 host interface,
* :doc:`memory-mapped-register` lists the memory mapped registers by address,
* :doc:`references` contains list of references,
* :doc:`further-work` lists things to be added to the documentation.
